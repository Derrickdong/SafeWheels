# SafeWheels
 
This is an app that created for school age kids to let them ride bike safely.

The final released version is the file called 'app-debug.apk' above. The team couldn't upload the app to the app store and the app cannot adapt to all mobile phones due to the lack of time in our final semester.

# Main Functions

1. You can get weather info from the app to determine wether you want to ride or not.

2. You can set a checking date of your bike, and you could see the checking sigh when the date comes.

3. The falling detection is on once the app has been opened. It will detect the falling of the phone and call the emergency Contact.

4. Speak of emergency contact, you could save a emergency contact of his/her phone number in the app and the app will call the emergency contact when there is something happens.

5. You can search the destination and get the navigation from our app. Unfortunately, we would like to provide turn by turn navigation, but Google doesn't allow people to use the api.

6. Once you have set the destination, the app would start timing, if the user couldn't make it to the destination for too long, the app would send a text message to the emergency contact with the user's current location. And if the user arrives the destination on time, the app would send a text message to emergency contact with an arrival message.

7. You could save and edit your favorite destinations and navigate by one click.
